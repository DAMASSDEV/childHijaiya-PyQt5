- Using PyQt5 requires installing the library in the following cmd:
 pip install PyQt5.

- Next, in order to change from .ui to .py files or change QtDesigner to PyQt5, type in the following cmd code:
  python -m PyQt5.uic.pyuic -x cek.ui -o cek.py

- I use the following module in the PyQt5 library:
  1. QtMultiMedia => Don't forget to install it in the cmd with pip install QtMultiMedia.
  2.QtCore.
  3.QtGui.
